Job work has been defined in CGST Act as under.\nJob work means any treatment or processing undertaken by a person on\ngoods belonging to another registered person and the expression job worker\nshall be construed accordingly.\n4.

Entry at item (id) covers only job work\nservices as defined in section 2 (68) of CGST Act, 2017, that is, services by way of\ntreatment or processing undertaken by a person on goods belonging to another\nregistered person. On the other hand, the entry at item (iv) specifically excludes the\nservices covered by entry at item (id), and therefore, covers only such services which\nare carried out on physical inputs (goods) which are owned by persons other than those\nregistered under the CGST Act.\n\n5.8 Hence, entry (id) covers job work services as defined in section 2(68) of CGST Act,\n2017, in respect of treatment or processing undertaken by a person on goods\n\nSam > belonging to another registered person.
