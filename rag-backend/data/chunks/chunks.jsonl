Job work means any treatment or processing undertaken by a person on goods belonging to another registered person and the expression job worker shall be construed accordingly. 4.

Entry at item (id) covers only job work services as defined in section 2 (68) of CGST Act, 2017, that is, services by way of treatment or processing undertaken by a person on goods belonging to another registered person. On the other hand, the entry at item (iv) specifically excludes the services covered by entry at item (id), and therefore, covers only such services which are carried out on physical inputs (goods) which are owned by persons other than those registered under the CGST Act. 5.8 Hence, entry (id) covers job work services as defined in section 2(68) of CGST Act, 2017, in respect of treatment or processing undertaken by a person on goods Sam > belonging to another registered person.
